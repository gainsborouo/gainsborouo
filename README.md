## About Me

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU).
Born and raised in Hsinchu, my taste buds have already been trained to survive the local "food desert" (?)

I enjoy playing badminton, photography, and turning money into things I like.
I like building stuff, from writing code to working on hardware, and sometimes I randomly pick up side projects.

If you have any interesting ideas, feel free to chat or collaborate with me!
